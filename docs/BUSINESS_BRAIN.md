# BUSINESS_BRAIN.md - The Strategic Hub for Light Ocean Studios

This document serves as the central "brain" for Light Ocean Studios, outlining the strategic vision and actionable next steps to launch and grow the business.

For a breakdown of the key roles and responsibilities, see the [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) file.

## 1. Business Overview

**Light Ocean Studios** is a high-end, minimalist candle brand with a "Meditative Coastal" aesthetic. The brand focuses on artisanal, hand-poured soy wax candles with premium, phthalate-free fragrances. The target audience values tranquility, mindfulness, and quality craftsmanship.

**Current State:**
- A beautiful, well-designed, and functional landing page is complete.
- The core brand identity (colors, fonts, tone) is established.
- A waitlist/email capture system is implemented using local storage (needs to be connected to an email marketing service).
- The product line is defined with three initial scent profiles, but product photography and detailed descriptions are pending.

## 2. Website Review

The current website is an excellent foundation. It effectively communicates the brand's aesthetic and values.

**Strengths:**
-   **Aesthetic Cohesion:** The design system is strong and consistently applied, creating a professional and appealing look.
-   **Modern & Performant:** The code is clean, responsive, and uses modern web development techniques.
-   **Clear User Journey:** The site guides visitors from the brand story to the products and encourages them to join the waitlist.
-   **Engaging Micro-interactions:** Animations and hover effects enhance the user experience.

**Areas for Improvement & Next Steps:**
-   **Email Marketing Integration:** The email capture form needs to be connected to a real email marketing platform (e.g., Mailchimp, ConvertKit, Klaviyo).
-   **E-commerce Functionality:** The site is currently a landing page. It needs a full e-commerce backend to handle products, inventory, payments, and shipping.
-   **Content:** The "Coming Soon" sections need to be filled with high-quality product photography and evocative scent descriptions.
