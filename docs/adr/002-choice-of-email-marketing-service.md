# 2. Choice of Email Marketing Service

**Status**: Proposed

**Context**:
The email capture form on the website currently saves emails to local storage. To build a waitlist and communicate with customers, this form must be connected to a professional email marketing service.

**Decision**:
The selected platform should offer robust automation features (e-mail sequences), good deliverability, and an interface that is easy for **The Marketer** to use. The leading candidates are:
1.  **Mailchimp**: Widely used, user-friendly, with a good free tier.
2.  **ConvertKit**: Built for creators, with a focus on powerful automations.
3.  **Klaviyo**: A premium choice with deep e-commerce integrations, especially for platforms like Shopify.

**Consequences**:
-   **Mailchimp**: A safe, standard choice. May become expensive as the list grows.
-   **ConvertKit**: Excellent for building an audience through content, which aligns with the brand's strategy.
-   **Klaviyo**: The best choice for a future-proof, e-commerce-focused strategy, but may be overkill for the pre-launch phase.

The final decision will be made by **The Marketer**, with input from **The Technologist** on the ease of integration.
