# 1. Selection of E-commerce Platform

**Status**: Proposed

**Context**:
The current website is a static landing page. To sell products, a full e-commerce solution is required to handle product catalogs, inventory, a shopping cart, and payment processing.

**Decision**:
The decision is to choose an e-commerce platform that is flexible, scalable, and aligns with the brand's high-end aesthetic. The primary options being considered are:
1.  **Shopify**: A fully-hosted, all-in-one solution that is easy to manage.
2.  **WooCommerce**: A self-hosted solution built on WordPress, offering high customizability.
3.  **Headless Commerce (e.g., Shopify Headless, Snipcart)**: A solution that separates the e-commerce backend from the frontend, allowing for maximum design freedom with the existing static site.

**Consequences**:
-   **Shopify**: Fastest to market, but may have limitations on deep customization of the user experience.
-   **WooCommerce**: High flexibility, but requires more maintenance and management of hosting/security.
-   **Headless**: Offers the best of both worlds for design but can be more complex to implement and integrate.

The final decision will be made by **The Technologist** and **The Visionary** based on budget, time-to-market, and long-term scalability needs.
